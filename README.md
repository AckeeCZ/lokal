## Description

This is a multi package repository of the **lokse** project. The project's goal is to faciliate the work with translations held in Google spreadsheet.

## Brief history

- The original idea is from [`localize-with-spreadsheet`](https://github.com/xavierha/localize-with-spreadsheet) package
- We adopted it and made a package "fork" [`ackee-localize-spreadsheet-sdk`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ackee-localize-spreadsheet-sdk) used by all 3 platforms (iOS, Android, Web)
- As the time went, other platforms (iOS, Android) abandoned the package and the Web platform remained as the only one using it
- Because of several reasons, the tool was reworked into the next generation version and first released in September 2020 (before Google [stopped support for unauthenticated access to its Sheets API](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/g-suite/migrate-your-apps-use-latest-sheets-api), which was on of the resons) üöÄ

## The name meaning

You're maybe curious what the name means. Some people can pronounce it as Lok≈°e which is a name for [Slovak potato flatbread](https://www.google.com/search?q=lok%C5%A1e+recipe&oq=lok%C5%A1e+recipe&aqs=chrome..69i57j0l7.2201j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8).  
Maybe it was an inspiration. But the truth is, it's a little pun. The name has evolved by abbreaviating the term localization sheet and transcripting Czech pronounciation:

**Loc**alization **She**et ‚û° **LocShe** ‚û° **LokShe** ("c" is pronounced as "k" in Czech) ‚û° **Lok≈†e** ("sh" is pronounced as "≈°") ‚û° **Lokse** ü§ì
